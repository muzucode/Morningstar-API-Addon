# Morningstar API Addon (APIdojo/RapidAPI.com)

**DISCLAIMER: This is purely an addon to APIDojo.net's Morningstar API found on RapidAPI.com.  There is no affiliation between myself or any other party involved in the production of the API.  The whole point of this addon is to make accessing the Morningstar API simpler and more fluid.**

## Purpose

This addon is intended to help with accessing the Morningstar API provided by APIdojo on RapidAPI.com.  Additionally, documentation for accessing the endpoints is provided below.  

**Note: There is a chance that some methods within the addon may not work over time depending on updates made to the API so I will be sure to make updates if requests come in. Thanks for understanding!**

The API can be found here: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/morning-star/endpoints
